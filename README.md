Huanglongbing (citrus greening) is a disease caused due to bacteria in citrus tree leaves, which causes considerable damage to citrus fruits worldwide. Efficient and fast methods for this disease detection must be carried out to minimize the losses occur due to Huanglongbing disease. In this paper we propose pattern recognition based system to detect Huanglongbing from one of the citrus fruit leaves i.e. Orange leaves. Our complete proposed system contains five vital steps: image acquisition, image seg-mentation, feature extraction, classification and real-time implementation on resource constrained devices. We use three key features based on shape, color and texture which includes, asymmetry index of shape features, Cb component of YCbCr color space and local binary patterns of leaf texture. We evaluate our method on two different classifier named, Support Vector Ma-chine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). By using our method we achieved an accuracy of 90.5% by correctly classify-ing normal and diseased leaf images.
